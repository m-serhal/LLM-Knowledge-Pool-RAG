LEEDTM RATING SYSTEM FOR GREEN BUILDINGS
Building sector is witnessing a significant shift toward greening and sustainability. To reduce
resource dependency and carbon footprint many organizations today are interested in designing
their buildings to be LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified; a
designation developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC).
Why Design Green?
1. Buildings in the U.S. consume more than 30% of total energy and 60% of electricity
annually.
2. Buildings consume 5 billion gallons of potable water per day to flush toilets.
3. A typical North American commercial construction project generates 2.5 pounds of solid
waste per square foot of floor space.
4. Studies of workers in green buildings reported productivity gains of up to 16%.
5. About ¼ of the increase in carbon dioxide is due to the building sector, Energy efficiency
may reduce this by 50%.
6. Buildings consume 40% of raw stone, gravel and sand, and 25% of virgin wood.
7. Building related sickness may cost between $60 and 400 billion per year.
8. People spend as much as 90% of their time indoors.
The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System
encourages and accelerates global adoption of sustainable green building and development
practices through the creation and implementation of universally understood and accepted tools
and performance criteria. LEED-based green design not only makes a positive impact on public
health and the environment, it also reduces operating costs, enhances building and
organizational marketability, potentially increases occupant productivity, and helps create a
sustainable community. The LEED Rating System typically recognizes performance in six key
areas of human and environmental health:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Factoids by LEED Category
Sustainable Sites
•

Vehicles are responsible for approximately 20% of U.S. greenhouse gases annually.

Water Efficiency
•

340 billion gallons of fresh water are withdrawn per day from rivers, streams, and
reservoirs to support residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and recreational
activities.

•

Almost 65% of water taken is discharged back to bodies of water after use.

•

Annual water deficiency for the US is 3,700 billion gallons.

•

US industries today use 36% less water than in 1950 due to reuse and Energy Policy
Act of 1992 mandating water conserving plumbing.

•

Water consumption rose 6 fold in the last century – double the rate of population.

Energy & Atmosphere
•

Coal-fired electric utilities produce almost 1/3 the total emission of nitrogen oxide by US
citizens.

•

Fundamental commissioning can increase building energy efficiency from 5-10%.

•

Buildings with measurement and verification programs save 10 to 20% the electricity of
buildings without.

•

“Lost Productivity” is equated with 20% of occupants complaining 30 minutes per month.

•

Occupancy sensors may save up to 60% of light energy costs in a building.

Materials & Resources
•

4% of US old growth forest remains.

•

20% of the world’s large ancient forests remain intact.

•

90% of residential construction is wood.

•

40% of the waste stream is due to construction and demolition.

•

Recycling an aluminum can uses 5% of the energy needed to create a new can out of
virgin mined aluminum.

Indoor Environmental Quality
•

A well-designed day-lit building is estimated to reduce energy use by 50% to 80%.

LEED certification
LEED certification is obtained after submitting an application documenting compliance with the
requirements of the rating system as well as paying registration and certification fees.
Certification is granted solely by the Green Building Council responsible for issuing the LEED
system used on the project. Fortunately, LEED is a very user-friendly system. In fact, a major
contributor to the success of LEED is the simplicity of its credit/point-based the rating system.
For each credit, the LEED standard identifies the detailed intent, requirements, and
technologies or strategies to achieve the credit. One or more points are available within each
credit, and points are achieved by meeting specified requirements.
Different LEED versions have varied scoring systems based on a set of required "prerequisites"
and a variety of "credits" in the six major categories listed above. In LEED version 2.2 (v2.2) for
new construction and major renovations for commercial buildings there are 69 possible points
and buildings can qualify for four levels of certification:
1. Certified – 26 to 32 points
2. Silver – 33 to 38 points
3. Gold – 39 to 51 points
4. Platinum – 52 to 69 points

Clearly, higher levels of distinction are achieved based on the points accrued.
Green building professionals can also become LEED accredited professional (LEED AP)
through the LEED Accredited Professional Exam. LEED AP certification draws people from all
walks of life and there is no prerequisite qualification required to challenge the exam. However
don't make the mistake of assuming the LEED AP is a casual credential; it requires an in-depth
of understanding of the prescribed material. Underestimating the level of knowledge required is
the number one reason the test has such a high failure rate (20% - 35% first time pass rate).
This course provides knowledge of LEED Rating System in easy Q & A format. The course
includes seven sections covering a basic overview and the description of six LEED categories.
This document is a constant work in progress and if you see something that should be in this
list, please let us know.

SECTION – 1
OVERVIEW
LEED is a national standard developed by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC)
to certify sustainable buildings. Since its inception in 1998, LEED has grown to encompass over
14,000 projects in 50 US States and 30 countries covering 1.062 billion square feet (99 km²) of
development area. The hallmark of LEED is that it is an open and transparent process where
the technical criteria proposed by the LEED committees are publicly reviewed for approval by
the more than 10,000 membership organizations that currently constitute the USGBC.

and provides access to essential information, software
tools and communications.
Registration also provides access to a database of
existing Credit Interpretation Requests and Rulings.

25

What feature of NC v2.2
allows for split submittal
of credits for review?

Web-based LEED Online submittals.

26

What is the procedure for
LEED certification?

LEED certification is obtained after submitting an application
documenting compliance with the requirements of the rating
system as well as paying registration and certification fees. A
project must satisfy all prerequisites and earn a minimum
number of points outlined in the LEED Rating System under
which it is registered.
The certification review process includes the following:
•
•
•
•
•

27

What are the
requirements of
application submittal?

Application Submittal
Administrative Review
Technical Review
Award
Schedule

The project team submits two copies of the project application
and the corresponding fee to the LEED Certification Manager.
A complete application includes the following:
•

A complete LEED-Online submittal must include the
following:
o

Overall project narrative including at least
three project highlights.

o

The LEED Project Checklist/Scorecard
indicating projected prerequisites and credits
and the total score for the project (If mixed
submittal, LEED v2.0 credits are to be noted
as such in LEED v2.1 Letter Template Credit
Summary or similar format.); and

o

28

Explain the
Administrative Review
Process.

An administrative compliance review is made by USGBC's
LEED committee and takes almost a week after the receipt of
the application. Each document is reviewed for compliance
and completeness. If the documentation is insufficient, the
project contact is notified of the deficiencies. The technical
review begins when the issues raised by the administrative
review are resolved.

29

Explain the Technical
Review Process.

Within two weeks of administrative approval, the USGBC
issues a Preliminary LEED Review document noting points
earned, pending and rejected. The project team has 30 days
from the receipt of the preliminary review to provide
corrections and/or additions to the application. The USGBC
conducts a Final LEED Review of the application within 30
days of receiving the resubmittal and recommends a final
application score to the LEED Steering Committee. The
LEED Steering Committee accepts or rejects the
recommended final application score within two weeks of
receipt and notifies the project contact of the LEED
Certification.

30

Explain the LEED
certification Award
process.

Upon notification of the LEED Certification, the project team
has 30 days to accept or appeal the awarded certification.
Upon the project’s acceptance, or if it has not appealed the
rating within 30 days, the LEED Certification is final. The
project may then be referred to as a LEED Certified Green
Building. The USGBC presents the project team with a
certificate and a metal LEED plaque indicating the
certification level. The appeal fee is $500 per credit

appealed.
31

What is the submittal
schedule for
documentation?

Once a project is registered, the project team begins to
prepare documentation and calculations to satisfy the
prerequisite and credit submittal requirements.
LEED NC V2.2 defines the submittal schedule as follows:

The official certification date of the project is the date USGBC
receives notice of a project team's acceptance of the Final
LEED Review. USGBC will then contact the project team
regarding fulfillment details, including their certificate and
LEED plaque.
33

Can the certification
schedule be
compressed?

The USGBC offers a compressed review schedule to
accommodate project dedications, media events or other
celebrations. The project’s specific time constraint must be
noted at the time of application and accompanied by a check
for double the certification fee.
The RUSH schedule is two weeks for Preliminary LEED
Review, two weeks for the project to resubmit for final review,
and two weeks for Final LEED Review (for a minimum of 6
weeks from receipt of the complete project application).

34

Do you have to pay

37

Do you get LEED credits
after design phase?

NO
After design phase - USGBC marks each credit as credit
anticipated or credit denied. They cannot actually reward
credits after the design phase.

Do you get LEED credits
after construction phase?

YES

What is a CIR?

Credit Interpretation Request

After construction phase - USGBC makes a ruling on each
credit as credit achieved or credit denied.

In some cases, project teams may encounter questions about
meeting the requirements of a LEED prerequisite or credit on
a specific project. If it is unclear whether or not a strategy
applies to a given credit, a credit interpretation request (CIR)
can be submitted and the ruling will determine the suitability
of the approach.
38

When should you submit
a CIR?

The recommended procedure for reviewing credit questions is
outlined below:
•

Consult the LEED Reference Guide for a detailed
description of the credit intent and requirements.

•

Check online resource for previous logged CIR by

other projects on relevant credits first. All LEED
project contacts have access to this page.
•

Only if a similar credit interpretation has not been
logged or does not answer your inquiry sufficiently,
then a new CIR via LEED-Online should be submitted.

39

How much time it takes
for CIR?

Normally, an official ruling by the USGBC Credit Ruling
Committee will be posted to the Credit Interpretation Rulings
page within three weeks.

40

Who is eligible to raise a
CIR?

CIRs can only be requested by LEED Registered Project
Team Members.

41

Is there a fee for CIR?

2 interpretation rulings are provided for free through the
USGBC.
Each additional CIRs attracts fees of $220.

42

Who can view the CIRs?

CIRs can be viewed by all USGBC members, non-members
with registered projects, and workshop attendees.

43

When submitting a CIR
what should you focus
on?

CIRs should be succint and based on information found in the
Reference Guide, with emphasis on the intent of the
prerequisite or credit. If possible the project team should offer
potential solutions to the problem.
•

Each CIR should refer to only one LEED credit and
one primary related strategy.The inquiry should only
include essential project strategy and background
information and should be presented in the context of
the credit intent (600 words maximum). When you
submit a credit for consideration for which you have
made a CIR ruling request, include both the request
and the ruling with your submission.

•

Submissions of drawings, cut-sheets,
attachments are NOT permitted.

Does project receive a
credit point at the time
the CIR request is
approved?

NO

47

Can project team appeal
against the award ruling?

YES
If a project team feels that sufficient grounds exist to appeal a
credit that has been denied in the Final LEED Review, it has
the option to appeal.
•

Appeals are $500 per credit.

•

You have 25 days to appeal after Final LEED Review.

•

Appeal submittals are all done via LEED-Online.

•

Because review will be done by a different review
team, appeals must include the LEED registration
information, including project contact, project type,
project size, number of occupants, date of
construction
completion,
and
other
relevant
documents submitted during the certification process.

48

What does LEED AP
mean?

AP stands for accredited professional. This certification is for
any building professional who has successfully passed the
LEED accredited professional status examination.

49

Does the LEED-AP on
the design team sign the
Letter Templates?

Only when they are the responsible party for the credit.

50

How are the LEED AP
exams administered?

The LEED AP exams are administered in the US and
territories by the Green Building Certification Institute (GBCI).
The computer based exam is given in a multiple-choice
format and is administered at computer testing centers.
Examinees may choose to take one of the three different
exam tracks (New Construction, Existing Buildings, or
Commercial Interiors).

51

How is LEED AP Exam
Structured?

There are 4 basic “sections” within the LEED AP Exam format
that you’ll be tested on:
•
•
•
•

Knowledge of LEED Credit Intents and Requirements
Coordinate Project and Team
Implement LEED Process
Verify, Participate in, and Perform Technical Analysis
Required for LEED Credits

The exam will test your knowledge of LEED standards,
synergies, strategies and intent.
52

53

What are the different
exam tracks for the
current LEED exams?

There are three different exam tracks for the LEED AP. You
only need to pass one to earn your credential.

What will the different
specialty exam tracks be

There will be five different specialty exam tracks for the
upcoming LEED AP+ credentialing program. You only need

•
•
•

LEED for New Construction, version 2.2
LEED for Commercial Interiors, version 2.0
LEED for Existing Buildings, version 2.0

for the new upcoming
LEED AP+ credentialing
program?

to pass one to earn your credential.

exam)

•

LEED AP+ Operations and Maintenance exam
(formerly called the LEED for Existing Buildings exam)

•

LEED AP+ Homes exam (this is a new exam track)

•

LEED AP+ Neighborhood Development exam (this is
a new exam track)

Please note that you will need to take and pass the LEED
Green Associate exam prior to, or in conjunction with, a
specialty exam in order to qualify for the LEED AP+
credential.
54

Which exam track should
I take?

It is best to take the exam track that covers topics you are
familiar with. To learn more about each exam track visit the
GBCI website.

55

Who can become LEED
AP?

Commonly engineers or architects who have studied LEED
requirements, goals and strategies, but there are no
experience requirements. Anybody can take the exam.
Individuals recognized for their knowledge of the LEED rating
system are permitted to use the LEED Accredited
Professional (AP) acronym after their name, indicating they
have passed the accreditation exam.

56

How do I apply to take a
LEED AP exam?

To register go to the GBCI website and download the
Candidate Handbook to get information about scheduling,
exam preparation, test-day procedures, and more. The
Candidate Handbook will provide you with information on how
to schedule an appointment at a testing center near you. The
appointments are given on a first come first serve basis.

57

What is the format and
time limit?

The current LEED exams are computer-based and multiple
choice. You are allowed to complete the exam in two hours.
The exam is closed book.

58

How is the exam scored?

The exam is graded by computer.
You must pass a 100 question exam and receive a score of
170/200 points.

59

What does LEED AP do?

This accreditation enables an individual to facilitate the rating
of buildings with the various LEED systems. LEED accredited
professionals guide design and construction teams through
the LEED process and offer ideas and strategies in achieving
LEED ranking.

60

What reference books
are available?

The LEED-NC Reference Guide V 2.2 – This contains
extensive background information and detailed guidance for
meeting the requirements LEED for New Construction. The
guide contains every LEED point in detail and includes not
only information on fulfilling the requirements of the rating
system, but also case studies, calculation methods, and other
resources.
There are going to be quite a few questions dealing with “who
does what”, or how the certification process works, which isn’t
directly mentioned in the reference guide. Many of these
answers are found online at the USGBC website - you just
have to fish for them.

61

Is there an International
LEED Rating System?

The World Green Building Council has been developed to
represent Green Building Councils throughout the world.
There are currently nine member countries six of which have
their own rating systems.

Sustainability is a holistic approach to designing and building. The main goals of sustainable
design are to reduce depletion of resources including energy, water, and raw materials;
minimize environmental damage caused by buildings and facilities throughout their life; and
create better building environments. In a rather simplistic explanation, sustainable practices
tend to promote energy efficiency and the use of products that are safer, renewable/ recyclable
and reduce harmful waste in their production. The local climate, geography and socio economic
factors all have to be taken into account when designing a green sustainable building. For
example, take a case of straw bale wall construction in a region devoid of straw. Sure, the wall
will function well from an insulating stand point but if you trucked in the straw bales from
hundreds/ thousands of miles or airlifted it in, how sustainable was that? Imagine all the fuel
burned and the pollutants released. If there was an abundance of soil and concrete, rammed
earth could have been better choice.
Achieving an effective sustainable design requires a collaborative process engaging the multiple
design disciplines, as well as users, construction managers, contractors and facility managers.
The merging of ideas, perspectives and areas of expertise facilitated by an open
communications process reaps multiple benefits, as the project team moves from the
optimization of single systems in isolation to the optimization of the entire building enterprise.
Establishing vertical support throughout the organization helps ensure success.
This category of credits is intended to reduce environmental damage, pollution and other
harmful effects due to building construction.

What do SS Credits
emphasize?

SS credits emphasize the environmental impact of
the structure that is impacted by site selection and
management. These are earned by minimizing
pollution sources, building into an existing urban
area, conserving undeveloped land, promoting
natural habitats, encouraging methods of alternative
transportation,
managing
stormwater,
and
diminishing the temperature differences between
developed and undeveloped areas.

70

SS CREDIT 7
What Is a Heat Island?

71

SS CREDIT 7
What Causes a Heat Island?

Heat islands are the characteristics of urban
air/surface temperatures that result in higher air
temperatures up to 10° F (5.6° C) warmer than
surrounding natural land cover.
Causes of the "heat island effect" include dark
surfaces--that absorb more heat from the sun--and
less vegetation that would provide shade and cool
the air.
As cities replace natural land cover with pavement,
buildings, and other structures, these built up areas
absorb more of the sun's heat, causing surface and
air temperatures to rise. The loss of trees and shrubs
also eliminates the natural cooling effects of shading
and evapo-transpiration, a process that draws heat
from the air to convert water contained in vegetation
to water vapor.

72

SS CREDIT 7
When do heat islands form?

Heat islands can occur at any time, regardless of
season or time of day. They are often largest in the
evening when urban areas release stored heat
energy into the air from roads and other structures.
This urban-rural cooling difference produces
maximum heat island intensities three to five hours
after sunset.

No.

Questions

Answers

73

SS CREDIT 7

Heat islands can increase air conditioning demand,
the incidence of heat-related illness and mortality,
and power plant emissions of air pollution and
greenhouse gases. In addition to this direct increase
in power plant emissions, elevated ambient
temperatures can speed up the heat-dependent
reaction that forms ground-level ozone.

SS CREDIT 7.2
What reflectance and
emissivity standards and
characteristics are required for
roofing under Credit 7.2?

83

SS CREDIT 7
What is albedo and SRI?

Use Energy Star® compliant and high emissivity
roofing of at least 0.9 when tested in accordance
with ASTM 408 and/or ASTM C 1371. Roofing
materials should have SRI values greater than 78 for
low-sloped roofs and 29 for steep-sloped roofs
(where SRI is measured according to ASTM E903,
ASTM E1918, and ASTM E1980).
Albedo or solar reflectance is the ability of a surface
material to reflect incident solar (short wave)
radiation. It is expressed on a scale of 0 (black) to 1
(white) where value of 0 indicates that the surface
absorbs all solar radiation, and a value of 1
represents total reflectivity. [Alternatively albedo can
be expressed in percentage scale of 0 % to 100%].
A newer method of evaluating coolness is the solar
reflectance index (SRI), which incorporates both
solar reflectance and emittance in a single value.
SRI quantifies how hot a surface would get relative
to standard black and standard white surfaces. It is
defined such that a standard black (reflectance 0.05,
emittance 0.90) is 0 and a standard white
(reflectance 0.80, emittance 0.90) is 100.

84

SS CREDIT 7
What is Emittance?

85

SS CREDIT 7

Emittance is the amount of thermal radiation – also
known as infrared or long wave radiation – that a
material releases or radiates away from its surface.
Emittance is expressed as a number between 0.0
and 1.0, or 0% and 100%. With the exception of
metals, most building materials have emittances
above 85%.
Cool roofs have a high solar reflectance, or albedo,
and may also have a high emittance. EPA’s Energy

No.

Questions

Answers

What is a Cool Roof?

Start Roof Product Program has cool roofing
specifications
for
both
low-slope
(primarily
commercial) and sloped (primarily residential) roofs.
EPA ENERGY STAR specifies an albedo of 0.65 or
higher for low-slope roofs and at least 0.25 for
steeped sloped roofs. Although emittance is not a
qualifying criterion for ENERGY STAR ®, a value of
at least 0.85 further reduces roof temperatures and
can decrease the amount of heat transferred to
building interiors.

86

SS CREDIT 7
What are the benefits of cool
roofs?

87

SS CREDIT 7
What are some examples of
cool roofing applications?

On a hot, sunny summer day, traditional roofing
materials can reach peak temperatures of 190°F
(88°C). By comparison, cool roofs reach maximum
temperatures of 120°F (49°C). In buildings with air
conditioning (AC), cool roofs can save money on
energy bills, lower peak energy demand, and reduce
power plant emissions of air pollution and
greenhouse gases. In buildings without AC, cool
roofs can increase indoor occupant comfort by
lowering top-floor temperatures. In both cases, cool
roofs can contribute to urban heat island mitigation.
Low-slope cool roofing applications, which are
typically used in the commercial building sector,
include single-ply and cool coatings. Single-ply
roofing is often constructed of white rubber or plastic
material that is glued or fastened over the entire roof
surface. Cool coatings have the consistency of thick
paint, and contain cement particles or elastomeric
polymers. They can be applied to a wide range of
existing and new roof surfaces.
Sloped cool roofing applications include concrete or
clay tile with a white pigment added to the surface or
mixed in during manufacturing. These products are
typically used in the residential sector.

SS CREDIT 7
What is a green roof?

89

SS CREDIT 7
What are the benefits of green
roofs?

Green roofs, or rooftop gardens, are planted over
existing roof structures, including industrial facilities,
residences, offices, and other commercial property.
These "living" roofs consist of a waterproof, root-safe

Green roofs are generally classified either as
intensive or extensive.
•

Intensive green roofs require a minimum of
one foot of soil. Trees and shrubs are usually
planted, adding 80 to 150 pounds per square
foot of load to the building. These roofs
require complex irrigation and drainage
systems, and significant maintenance.
Intensive roofs are often accessible to the
public.

•

Extensive green roofs require only 1 to 5
inches of soil. Low lying plants and grasses
are usually planted, and 12 to 50 pounds per
square foot of load may be added. These
roofs use simple irrigation and drainage
systems, and require little maintenance.
Extensive green roofs usually are not
accessible to the public.

Ozone is an odorless, colorless gas that can be
"good" or "bad" depending on where it is in the
atmosphere. "Good" ozone occurs in the
stratosphere, approximately 10 to 50 kilometers
above the Earth's surface, where it forms a
protective layer that shields earth habitants from
harmful ultraviolet radiation. Stratospheric ozone
forms what is known as the ozone layer. Ozone layer
depletion can be controlled by eliminating use of
CFC refrigerants and other chlorine based products.
"Bad" ozone, or ground-level ozone, exists closer to
the Earth's surface. Ground-level ozone is formed by

Reduce development impact on nocturnal
environments.

Light pollution is the unwanted illumination of the
night sky created by human activity. Light pollution is
sometimes said to be an undesirable byproduct of
our industrialized civilization. Light pollution is a
broad term that refers to multiple problems, all of
which are caused by inefficient, annoying, or
arguably unnecessary use of artificial light. Specific
types of light pollution include light trespass, overillumination and sky glow.
As its name implies, light trespass occurs when
unwanted light spills over beyond the boundary of
the property on which a light is located to adjacent
properties. Light trespass is often caused by high or
poorly positioned lights. The result is bright night
lighting on an area that would otherwise be dark.
Certainly it is important to have adequate light for
safety and security, however, when misapplied,
additional problems are created.

96

SS CREDIT 8
What is Over Illumination?

97

SS CREDIT 8

Over illumination is the use of light well beyond that
required for a specific activity. Many places, both
indoors and out, have lights on when no people are
present. In many cases, this goes beyond the need
for security lighting. Think of office buildings that
have lights on all night even though the buildings are
virtually empty.
Sky glow is the bright ‘glow’ seen over many cities
and towns in the evening. It is the result of the many

Questions

Answers

What is Sky glow?

electric lighting fixtures that shed light above urban
areas. It is caused by light traveling through the
atmosphere being refracted or scattered by water
droplets or particles (aerosols) such as dust, pollen,
bacteria, spores, salt from sea spray, mineral
particles lifted from deserts and waste products from
industry. It is therefore worse in heavily polluted
areas, and will always exist to some extent when the
air quality is poor.

SS CREDIT 8

Light pollution is a strong indicator of wasted energy.

Why do we care about light
pollution?

Astronomers (both professional and amateur) have
been concerned about the deteriorating quality of the
night sky to conduct their observations and research.
Medical research on the effects of excessive indoor
light on the human body suggests a variety of
adverse
health
effects
including
increased
headaches, fatigue, and stress.
Lights at night can impact both the biology and
ecology of species in the wild. Some examples
include the disorientation of sea turtle hatchlings by
beachfront lighting; nesting choices and breeding
success of birds; behavioral and physiological
changes in salamanders; disturbances of nocturnal
animals; and altered natural light regimes in
terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

buildings and public and paved areas.

•

Site in proximity to transit options.

•

Establish a transportation plan. Support alternatives to fossil fueled single occupancy
vehicles (preferred van/carpool parking, bike parking and changing facilities, electric car

charging and other alternate vehicle fueling, nearby transit access). Reduce paved
parking area appropriately.
•

foot-candle requirements as stated in the Recommended Practice Manual: Lighting for
Exterior Environments, and design interior and exterior lighting such that zero direct
beam illumination leaves the building site.

SECTION - 3
WATER EFFICIENCY
Water efficient design strategies balance water quality and quantity demands within a building
and are responsive to the watershed's capacity as source and sink. Public works projects, such
as treatment plants and sewage systems, are unable to adequately remove or process the toxic
materials that infiltrate these systems, potentially threatening public health.
This category encourage owners/designers to take a systematic look to identify potential water
sources, how water is used in the building and how it flows around the building site to reduce
water usage and wastewater discharges. The credits are earned by reducing or eliminating the
use of potable water for landscape irrigation, reducing wastewater, and reducing overall water
consumption. The goals are to:
1. Minimize the use of potable water while conserving water quality and availability.
2. Minimize off site treatment of wastewater.
3. Minimize storm water release from the site.
4. Maximize use of on-site water resources, (e.g., rainwater, graywater).
5. Match water quality with end use requirements.
6. Maximize aquifer recharge.

SECTION- 4
ENERGY AND ATMOSPHERE
The burning of fossil fuels is the single largest contributor to global climate change, as well as a
contributor to a host of toxic emissions that impair the environmental health of directly affected
communities and the world. Rising energy prices impose a significant economic imperative that
requires a careful examination of understanding how to best assure a comfortable healthy
indoor environment supportive of patient recovery with a significantly reduced energy demand.
This category encourage owners/designers to take a comprehensive, systematic look at the
building and site’s energy flows to reduce energy bills, evaluate opportunities for reliance on
renewable energy sources, and improve environmental health outcomes. By increasing energy
efficiency, the demand for electrical power is lessened, and the use of raw materials required to
generate the power is reduced. Green power generation methods such as solar or wind reduce
carbon emissions and associated global warming. The credit for minimizing atmospheric impact
is achieved by using no refrigerant, or by using a refrigerant that has low ozone depletion and
global warming potential.
No.

MATERIAL RESOURCES
Use of sustainable materials can significantly enhance a building's environmental health
performance. The sustainable harvest of materials enhances the health of habitats and
increases biodiversity.
This category encourages owners/designers to take a comprehensive, systematic look at
material specifications so as to eliminate harmful health effects. The majority of credits in this
category are gained through reuse and recycling of building materials. Credits are available for:
reusing existing building structures, reusing or recycling building materials, and diverting
building materials from disposal for recycling or reuse.
Credits are also available for using local materials, rapidly renewable materials, and utilizing
certified wood products. The local material credits emphasize a reduction in environmental
impact from transportation. The use of rapidly renewable materials eases the depletion of nonrenewable resources.
No.

SECTION- 6
INDOOR ENVIRONMENT QUALITY
Growing awareness about the relationship between indoor environmental quality -- materials,
lighting, thermal comfort -- and human health and productivity has catalyzed substantial
research to support healthier buildings. Eliminating materials identified as allergens, mutagens,
carcinogens and endocrine disruptors, while providing access to daylight and comfortable
indoor climate, are fundamental green building elements.
This LEED category encourages owners and designers to engage in a design process that
balances the objectives of a well day lit, comfortable, energy efficient and non-toxic indoor
environment and results in improved productivity and patient outcomes. This LEED category
focuses on the creation and maintenance of a comfortable, occupant-friendly indoor
environment with credits for air quality, thermal comfort, day lighting and providing outdoor
views. Indoor air quality credits are obtained by effectively ventilating the indoor space, utilizing
low-emitting construction materials (paints, carpets, adhesives), and minimizing the potential for
pollutants to infiltrate the occupied space. Thermal comfort credits are obtained by providing
temperature controlled working environment and giving a majority of occupants the capability to
make adjustments for personal comfort. Day lighting credits are obtained for providing a majority
of occupants with natural lighting.
No.

Summarizing……
Suggested Strategies for Indoor Environment Quality include but not limited to:
•

Ensure high quality indoor air by meeting or exceeding ASHRAE 62-1999 as a basis of
design.

•

Ensure thermal comfort by meeting or exceeding ASHRAE 55-1992 as a basis of
design.

•

Specify low VOC / low toxic finishes and materials, such as Green Seal-certified paints;
composite wood and agrifiber products with no added urea-formaldehyde resins; carpet
systems certified by Carpet & Rug Institute Green Label Program; adhesives meeting
South Coast Air Quality Management District guidelines; flooring, ceiling wall covering,
paints and other interior finishes and materials meeting Washington State indoor air
quality guidelines.

•

Minimize use of carpets and other materials that attract, absorb and re-release indoor
pollutants.

•

Specify permeable wall covering and other materials to prevent trapping of water and
microbial growth.

•

Establish green housekeeping protocols.

•

Design to reduce pest infestation opportunities.

•

Install permanent entryway systems (e.g., grates) to trap dirt and particulates.

•

Position air intakes to prevent contamination from vehicle exhaust and other sources
paying attention to prevailing winds.

•

Assure easy access to inspect and clean filters and ductwork in each straight run.

•

Ventilate enclosed parking areas and other source areas (smoking areas, housekeeping,
copying rooms, hazardous waste).

•

If building cannot be 100% non smoking, provide total environmental separation for non
smokers and assure no feed in to ventilation system.

•

Provide building occupants access to daylight, views and operable windows where
appropriate.

•

Provide user controls for airflow, temperature, light (integrated with daylighting - see also
Energy section).

•

Provide carbon dioxide monitoring system to provide feedback on space ventilation
performance.

•

Specify materials, products, mechanical systems and design features to attenuate sound
and vibration, and not to exceed Room Criteria (RC) ratings listed for Hospital and
Clinics in Table 34 of Chapter 46, Sound and Vibration Control, 1999 ASHRAE
Application Handbook.

SECTION - 7
INNOVATION AND DESIGN PROCESS
Every building is a unique blend of site, program, people, budget, with a unique set of
challenges and opportunities. Innovative, integrative design practices recognize that new
solutions emerge from a process of creative problem solving and "thinking out of the box".
Currently, projects pursuing LEED Certification have the opportunity to earn up to four points for
two types of credits in the Innovation & Design Process (ID) credit category: exemplary
performance related to existing LEED credits and innovative performance.
LEED ID Credit 1 - Innovations in Design credits for innovative performance are awarded up to
4 points in one of two ways:
•

By significantly exceeding the requirements of the rating system, or

•

Alternatively by demonstrating innovation by a method that is not specifically addressed
by current LEED rating systems.

As a general rule of thumb, ID credits for exceptional performance are awarded for doubling the
credit requirements and/or achieving the next incremental percentage threshold. For instance,
an ID credit for exemplary performance in water use reduction (WE Credit 3) would require a
minimum of 40% savings (20%=WE Credit 3.1; 30%=WE Credit 3.2, etc.).
Note that the LEED ID Credits are evaluated for each project. It is important to note that the
award of an ID Credit for one project at a specific point in time does not constitute automatic
approval for a similar strategy in a future project. Innovation credits are not awarded for the use
of a particular product or design strategy if the technology aids in the achievement of an existing
LEED credit.
LEED ID Credit 2 - One credit may be obtained in this category if a participant on the project
team holds LEED accreditation. Please note that only one point is awarded regardless of how
many LEED Accredited Professionals are on the team.
No.
