INTEGRATIVE PROCESS
PREREQUISITE: INTEGRATIVE PROJECT PLANNING AND DESIGN
Required
This prerequisite applies to:
• Healthcare
Intent
Maximize opportunities for integrated, cost-effective adoption of green design and construction strategies,
emphasizing human health as a fundamental evaluative criterion for building design, construction and
operational strategies. Utilize innovative approaches and techniques for green design and construction.
Requirements
HEALTHCARE
Use cross-discipline design and decision making, beginning in the programming and pre-design phase. At a
minimum, ensure the following process:
Owner’s Project Requirements Document. Prepare an Owner’s Project Requirements (OPR) document.
Develop a health mission statement and incorporate it in the OPR. The health mission statement must
address "triple bottom line" values—economic, environmental and social. Include goals and strategies to
safeguard the health of building occupants, the local community and the global environment, while creating a
high-performance healing environment for the building’s patients, caregivers and staff.
Preliminary Rating Goals. As early as practical and preferably before schematic design, conduct a
preliminary LEED meeting with a minimum of four key project team members and the owner or owner’s
representative. As part of the meeting, create a LEED® action plan that, at a minimum:
 Determines the LEED certification level to pursue (Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum);
 Selects the LEED credits to meet the targeted certification level; and
 Identifies the responsible parties to ensure the LEED requirements for each prerequisite and selected
credit are met.
Integrated Project Team. Assemble an integrated project team and include as many of the following
professionals as feasible (minimum of four), in addition to the owner or owner’s representative.

Intent
To support high-performance, cost-effective project outcomes through an early analysis of the
interrelationships among systems.

Requirements
NC, CS, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, DATA CENTERS, WAREHOUSES & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY,
HEALTHCARE
Beginning in pre-design and continuing throughout the design phases, identify and use opportunities to
achieve synergies across disciplines and building systems. Use the analyses described below to inform
the owner’s project requirements (OPR), basis of design (BOD), design documents, and construction
documents.
Energy-Related Systems
Discovery: Perform a preliminary “simple box” energy modeling analysis before the completion of
schematic design that explores how to reduce energy loads in the building and accomplish related
sustainability goals by questioning default assumptions. Assess at least two potential strategies
associated with the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Site conditions. Assess shading, exterior lighting, hardscape, landscaping, and adjacent site
conditions.
Massing and orientation. Assess massing and orientation affect HVAC sizing, energy
consumption, lighting, and renewable energy opportunities.
Basic envelope attributes. Assess insulation values, window-to-wall ratios, glazing
characteristics, shading, and window operability.
Lighting levels. Assess interior surface reflectance values and lighting levels in occupied
spaces.
Thermal comfort ranges. Assess thermal comfort range options.
Plug and process load needs. Assess reducing plug and process loads through
programmatic solutions (e.g., equipment and purchasing policies, layout options).
Programmatic and operational parameters. Assess multifunctioning spaces, operating
schedules, space allotment per person, teleworking, reduction of building area, and
anticipated operations and maintenance.

Implementation: Document how the above analysis informed design and building form decisions in
the project’s OPR and BOD and the eventual design of the project, including the following, as
applicable:

Updated to reflect the July 25, 2019 LEED v4 Building Design and Construction Addenda

•
•
•
•
•

Building and site program;
Building form and geometry;
Building envelope and façade treatments on different orientations;
Elimination and/or significant downsizing of building systems (e.g., HVAC, lighting, controls,
Exterior materials, interior finishes, and functional program elements); and
Other systems.

AND
Water-Related Systems
Discovery: Perform a preliminary water budget analysis before the completion of schematic design that
explores how to reduce potable water loads in the building and accomplish related sustainability goals.
Assess and estimate the project’s potential nonpotable water supply sources and water demand volumes,
including the following:
•
•
•
•

Indoor water demand. Assess flow and flush fixture design case demand volumes, calculated
in accordance with WE Prerequisite Indoor Water Use Reduction.
Outdoor water demand. Assess landscape irrigation design case demand volume calculated
in accordance with WE Credit Outdoor Water-Use Reduction.
Process water demand. Assess kitchen, laundry, cooling tower, and other equipment demand
volumes, as applicable.
Supply sources. Assess all potential nonpotable water supply source volumes, such as onsite rainwater and graywater, municipally supplied nonpotable water, and HVAC equipment
condensate.

Implementation: Document how the above analysis informed building and site design decisions in
the project’s OPR and BOD. Demonstrate how at least one on-site nonpotable water supply source
was analyzed to reduce the burden on municipal supply or wastewater treatment systems by
contributing to at least two of the water demand components listed above. Demonstrate how the
analysis informed the design of the project, including the following, as applicable:
•
•
•
•
•
•

plumbing systems;
sewage conveyance and/or on-site treatment systems;
rainwater quantity and quality management systems;
landscaping, irrigation, and site elements;
roofing systems and/or building form and geometry; and
other systems.

power conditioning equipment, critical distribution equipment, heat rejection plants, and mechanical and
electrical support rooms.
Include in process loads both the unregulated load and the IT equipment load. The IT load comprises
critical systems and electrical power transformation, which may include servers, storage and networking
power use, and operations affecting monthly server CPU utilization percentages.
Develop two sets of IT load models using two scenarios, one at the maximum estimated IT load rating
and the second at the startup IT rating expected at the time of commissioning.
Document the energy modeling input assumptions for unregulated loads. Unregulated loads should be
modeled accurately to reflect the actual expected energy consumption of the building.
If unregulated loads are not identical for both the baseline and the proposed building performance rating,

baselines in Appendix 3, Tables 1–4, represent industry standards and may be used without additional
documentation. Calculate the baseline and design as follows:
•

•

•

Appliances and equipment. For appliances and equipment not covered in Tables 1–4, indicate
hourly energy use for proposed and budget equipment, along with estimated daily use hours. Use
the total estimated appliance/equipment energy use in the energy simulation model as a plug
load. Reduced use time (schedule change) is not a category of energy improvement in this credit.
ENERGY STAR ratings and evaluations are a valid basis for performing this calculation.
Display lighting. For display lighting, use the space-by-space method of determining allowed
lighting power under ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1–2010, with errata (or a USGBCapproved equivalent standard for projects outside the U.S.), to determine the appropriate
baseline for both the general building space and the display lighting.

Calculate surface area of assembly layers based on the manufacturer’s documentation for application.
If 90% of an assembly meets the criteria, the system counts as 100% compliant. If less than 50% of an
assembly meets the criteria, the assembly counts as 0% compliant.
Manufacturers’ claims. Both first-party and third-party statements of product compliance must follow the
guidelines in CDPH SM V1.1–2010, Section 8. Organizations that certify manufacturers’ claims must be
accredited under ISO Guide 65.
Laboratory requirements. Laboratories that conduct the tests specified in this credit must be accredited
under ISO/IEC 17025 for the test methods they use.
Emissions and Content Requirements
To demonstrate compliance, a product or layer must meet all of the following requirements, as applicable.
Inherently nonemitting sources. Products that are inherently nonemitting sources of VOCs (stone,
ceramic, powder-coated metals, plated or anodized metal, glass, concrete, clay brick, and unfinished or
untreated solid wood) are considered fully compliant without any VOC emissions testing if they do not
include integral organic-based surface coatings, binders, or sealants.
General emissions evaluation. Building products must be tested and determined compliant in accordance
with California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Standard Method v1.1–2010, using the applicable
exposure scenario. The default scenario is the private office scenario. The manufacturer’s or third-party
certification must state the exposure scenario used to determine compliance. Claims of compliance for
wet-applied products must state the amount applied in mass per surface area.
119
Updated to reflect the July 25, 2019 LEED v4 Building Design and Construction Addenda

Manufacturers’ claims of compliance with the above requirements must also state the range of total VOCs
after 14 days (336 hours), measured as specified in the CDPH Standard Method v1.1:
• 0.5 mg/m3 or less;
• between 0.5 and 5.0 mg/m3; or
• 5.0 mg/m3 or more.
Projects outside the U.S. may use products tested and deemed compliant in accordance with either (1)
the CDPH standard method (2010) or (2) the German AgBB Testing and Evaluation Scheme (2010).
Test products either with (1) the CDPH Standard Method (2010), (2) the German AgBB Testing and
Evaluation Scheme (2010), (3) ISO 16000-3: 2010, ISO 16000-6: 2011, ISO 16000-9: 2006, ISO 1600011:2006 either in conjunction with AgBB, or with French legislation on VOC emission class labeling, or (4)
the DIBt testing method (2010). If the applied testing method does not specify testing details for a
product group for which the CDPH standard method does provide details, use the specifications in the
CDPH standard method. U.S. projects must follow the CDPH standard method.
Additional VOC content requirements for wet-applied products. In addition to meeting the general
requirements for VOC emissions (above), on-site wet-applied products must not contain excessive levels
of VOCs, for the health of the installers and other tradesworkers who are exposed to these products. To
demonstrate compliance, a product or layer must meet the following requirements, as applicable.
Disclosure of VOC content must be made by the manufacturer. Any testing must follow the test method
specified in the applicable regulation.
• All paints and coatings wet-applied on site must meet the applicable VOC limits of the California
Air Resources Board (CARB) 2007, Suggested Control Measure (SCM) for Architectural
Coatings, or the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) Rule 1113, effective
June 3, 2011.
• All adhesives and sealants wet-applied on site must meet the applicable chemical content
requirements of SCAQMD Rule 1168, July 1, 2005, Adhesive and Sealant Applications, as

apply to adhesives and sealants subject to state or federal consumer product VOC regulations.
• For projects outside the U.S., all paints, coatings, adhesives, and sealants wet-applied on site
must either meet the technical requirements of the above regulations, or comply with applicable
national VOC control regulations, such as the European Decopaint Directive (2004/42/EC), the
Canadian VOC Concentration Limits for Architectural Coatings, or the Hong Kong Air Pollution
Control (VOC) Regulation.
• If the applicable regulation requires subtraction of exempt compounds, any content of
intentionally added exempt compounds larger than 1% weight by mass (total exempt compounds)
must be disclosed.
• If a product cannot reasonably be tested as specified above, testing of VOC content must comply
with ASTM D2369-10; ISO 11890, part 1; ASTM D6886-03; or ISO 11890-2.
• For projects in North America, methylene chloride and perchloroethylene may not be intentionally
added in paints, coatings, adhesives, or sealants.
Composite Wood Evaluation. Composite wood, as defined by the California Air Resources Board,
Airborne Toxic Measure to Reduce Formaldehyde Emissions from Composite Wood Products Regulation,
must be documented to have low formaldehyde emissions that meet the California Air Resources Board
ATCM for formaldehyde requirements for ultra-low-emitting formaldehyde (ULEF) resins or no added
formaldehyde resins.
Salvaged and reused architectural millwork more than one year old at the time of occupancy is
considered compliant, provided it meets the requirements for any site-applied paints, coatings, adhesives,
and sealants.
Furniture evaluation. New furniture and furnishing items must be tested in accordance with ANSI/BIFMA
Standard Method M7.1–2011. Comply with ANSI/BIFMA e3-2011 Furniture Sustainability Standard,

modeling approach or the emissions factor approach. Model the test results using the open plan, private
office, or seating scenario in ANSI/BIFMA M7.1, as appropriate. USGBC-approved equivalent testing
methodologies and contaminant thresholds are also acceptable. For classroom furniture, use the
standard school classroom model in CDPH Standard Method v1.1. Documentation submitted for furniture
must indicate the modeling scenario used to determine compliance.
Salvaged and reused furniture more than one year old at the time of use is considered compliant,
provided it meets the requirements for any site-applied paints, coatings, adhesives, and sealants.
Healthcare, Schools only
Additional insulation requirements. Batt insulation products may contain no added formaldehyde,
including urea formaldehyde, phenol formaldehyde, and urea-extended phenol formaldehyde.
Exterior applied products. Adhesives, sealants, coatings, roofing, and waterproofing materials applied on
site must meet the VOC limits of California Air Resources Board (CARB) 2007 Suggested Control
Measure (SCM) for Architectural Coatings, and South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD),
Rule 1168, effective July 1, 2005. Small containers of adhesives and sealants subject to state or federal
consumer product VOC regulations are exempt.

around the filtration media. Immediately before occupancy, replace all filtration media with the final design
filtration media, installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
VOCs. Schedule construction procedures to minimize exposure of absorbent materials to VOC emissions.
Complete painting and sealing before storing or installing “dry” materials, which may accumulate
pollutants and release them over time. Store fuels, solvents, and other sources of VOCs separately from
absorbent materials.
Outdoor emissions. For renovation projects involving waterproofing, repairing asphalt roofing, sealing
parking lots, or other outdoor activities that generate high VOC emissions, develop a plan to manage
fumes and avoid infiltration to occupied spaces. Comply with the procedures established by NIOSH,
Asphalt Fume Exposures during the Application of Hot Asphalt to Roofs (Publication 2003–112).
Tobacco. Prohibit the use of tobacco products inside the building and within 25 feet (7.5 meters) of the
building entrance during construction.
Noise and vibration. Develop a plan based on the British Standard (BS 5228) to reduce noise emissions
and vibrations from construction equipment and other nonroad engines by specifying low-noise emission
design or the lowest decibel level available that meets performance requirements in the British Standard.
Construction crews must wear ear protection in areas where sound levels exceed 85 dB for extended
periods.
Infection control. For renovations and additions adjacent to occupied facilities or phased occupancy in
new construction, follow the FGI 2010 Guidelines for Design and Construction of Health Care Facilities
and the Joint Commission on Standards to establish an integrative infection control team comprising the
owner, designer, and contractor to evaluate infection control risk and document the required precautions
in a project-specific plan. Use the infection control risk assessment standard published by the American
Society of Healthcare Engineering and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a
guideline to assess risk and to select mitigation procedures for construction activities.

Intent
To establish better quality indoor air in the building after construction and during occupancy.
Requirements
NC, SCHOOLS, RETAIL, DATA CENTERS, WAREHOUSES & DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, HOSPITALITY, HEALTHCARE
Select one of the following two options, to be implemented after construction ends and the building has
been completely cleaned. All interior finishes, such as millwork, doors, paint, carpet, acoustic tiles, and
movable furnishings (e.g., workstations, partitions), must be installed, and major VOC punch list items
must be finished. The options cannot be combined.
Option 1. Flush-Out (1 point)
Path 1. Before Occupancy
Install new filtration media and perform a building flush-out by supplying a total air volume of 14,000 cubic
feet of outdoor air per square foot (4 267 140 liters of outdoor air per square meter) of gross floor area
while maintaining an internal temperature of at least 60°F (15°C) and no higher than 80°F (27°C) and
relative humidity no higher than 60%.
OR
Path 2. During Occupancy
If occupancy is desired before the flush-out is completed, the space may be occupied only after delivery
of a minimum of 3,500 cubic feet of outdoor air per square foot (1 066 260 liters of outdoor air per square
meter) of gross floor area while maintaining an internal temperature of at least 60°F (15°C) and no higher
than 80°F (27°C) and relative humidity no higher than 60%..
Once the space is occupied, it must be ventilated at a minimum rate of 0.30 cubic foot per minute (cfm)
per square foot of outdoor air (1.5 liters per second per square meter of outside air) or the design
minimum outdoor air rate determined in EQ Prerequisite Minimum Indoor Air Quality Performance,
whichever is greater. During each day of the flush-out period, ventilation must begin at least three hours
before occupancy and continue during occupancy. These conditions must be maintained until a total of
14,000 cubic feet per square foot of outdoor air (4 270 liters of outdoor air per square meter) has been
delivered to the space.
OR
Option 2. Air Testing (2 points)
After construction ends and before occupancy, but under ventilation conditions typical for occupancy,
conduct baseline IAQ testing using protocols consistent with the methods listed in Table 1 for all occupied
spaces. Use current versions of ASTM standard methods, EPA compendium methods, or ISO methods,
as indicated. Laboratories that conduct the tests for chemical analysis of formaldehyde and volatile

HEALTHCARE
Design the facility to meet or exceed the sound and vibration criteria outlined below, which are adapted
from the 2010 FGI Guidelines for Design and Construction of Health Care Facilities (“2010 FGI
Guidelines”) and the reference document on which it is based, Sound and Vibration Design Guidelines for
Health Care Facilities (“2010 SV Guidelines”).
Option 1. Speech Privacy, Sound Isolation, and Background Noise (1 point)
Speech Privacy and Sound Isolation
Design sound isolation to achieve speech privacy, acoustical comfort, and minimal annoyance from
noise-producing sources. Consider sound levels at both source and receiver locations, the background
sound at receiver locations, and the occupants’ acoustical privacy and acoustical comfort needs. Speech
privacy is defined as “techniques … to render speech unintelligible to casual listeners” (ANSI T1.5232001, Telecom Glossary 2007).
Design the facility to meet the criteria outlined in the sections of Table 1.2-3, Design Criteria for Minimum
Sound Isolation Performance between Enclosed Rooms, and Table 1.2-4 Speech Privacy for Enclosed
Room and Open-Plan Spaces (in the 2010 FGI Guidelines and 2010 SV Guidelines).
Calculate or measure sound isolation and speech privacy descriptors achieved for representative
adjacencies as necessary to confirm compliance with the criteria in the 2010 FGI Guidelines, Sections1.26.1.5 and 1.2-6.1.6, and the 2010 SV Guidelines (including the appendix).
Background Noise
Consider background noise levels generated by all building mechanical-electrical-plumbing systems, air
distribution systems and other facility noise sources under the purview of the project building designconstruction team.
Design the facility to meet the 2010 FGI Guidelines, Table 1.2-2 Minimum-Maximum Design Criteria for
Noise in representative interior rooms and spaces.
Calculate or measure sound levels in representative rooms and spaces of each type to confirm
compliance with criteria in the above-referenced table using a sound level meter that conforms to ANSI
S1.4 for type 1 (precision) or type 2 (general purpose) sound measurement instrumentation. For spaces
not listed in Table 1.2-2, refer to ASHRAE 2011 Handbook, Chapter 48, Sound and Vibration Control,
Table 1.
Option 2. Acoustical Finishes and Site Exterior Noise (1 point)
Meet the requirements for acoustical finishes and site exterior noise.
Acoustical Finishes
Specify materials, products systems installation details, and other design features to meet the 2010 FGI
Guidelines, Table 1.2-1, Design Room Sound Absorption Coefficients (including associated sections of
the appendix) and the 2010 SV Guidelines.
138
Updated to reflect the July 25, 2019 LEED v4 Building Design and Construction Addenda

Calculate or measure the average sound absorption coefficients for representative unoccupied rooms of
each type in the building to confirm conformance with the requirements.
Site Exterior Noise
Minimize the effect on building occupants of site exterior noise produced by road traffic, aircraft flyovers,
railroads, on-site heliports, emergency power generators during maintenance testing, outdoor facility MEP
and building services equipment, etc. Also minimize effects on the surrounding community from all facility
MEP equipment and activities as required to meet (1) local applicable codes or (2) Table 1.2-1 of the
2010 FGI Guidelines, Table 1.2-1, and the 2010 SV Guidelines, Table 1.3-1, whichever is more stringent.
Comply with the 2010 FGI Guidelines for the following noise sources:
• heliports, A1.3-3.6.2.2;
• generators, 2.1-8.3.3.1;
• mechanical equipment, 2.1-8.2.1.1; and
• building services, A2.2-5.3
Measure and analyze data to determine the exterior noise classification (A, B, C, or D) of the facility site.
See the 2010 FGI Guidelines, Categorization of Health Care Facility Sites by Exterior Ambient Sound,
Table A1.2a, and the 2010 SV Guidelines, Table 1.3-1.
Design the building envelope composite STC rating based on the 2010 FGI Guidelines, Categorization of
Health Care Facility Sites by Exterior Ambient Sound, and show conformance with requirements.
For exterior site exposure categories B, C, or D, calculate or measure the sound isolation performance of
representative elements of the exterior building envelope to determine the composite sound transmission
class (STCc) rating for representative façade sections. Measurements should generally conform to ASTM
E966, Standard Guide for Field Measurements of Airborne Sound Insulation of Building Façades and
Façade Elements, current edition.
